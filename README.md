# MedQGraph Software - Beta 
# Temporal Medical Record Knowledge Graphs for AI-Driven Healthcare Insights

## Overview

Medical records and doctor-patient transcripts contain valuable insights that can significantly improve healthcare decision-making. However, these records are often unstructured, making it difficult to extract and analyze patient history over time. Our project proposes a **Temporal Medical Record Knowledge Graph (TMKG)** that transforms doctor transcripts into structured, queryable knowledge graphs. This system enables healthcare professionals to ask complex medical questions spanning multiple patient histories and time periods, unlocking deeper insights for diagnosis, treatment, and research.

## Challenge
Currently, medical records exist as disparate text-based documents, making it challenging to:
- Reduce the time required for hospital staff to access and interpret patient medical histories, enabling faster and more accurate treatment decisions.
- Extract meaningful relationships between patient encounters, conditions, and treatments.
- Analyze patient health trajectories over time.
- Perform efficient retrieval of relevant information for clinical decision-making.

Our solution addresses these challenges by leveraging knowledge graph techniques combined with Large Language Models (LLMs) and temporal data representations to structure and organize medical transcripts.

## Solution

Our solution transforms unstructured medical transcripts into a **Temporal Medical Knowledge Graph (TMKG)**. Using the MIMIC dataset, we preprocess data into structured JSON format, construct a knowledge graph with nodes and relationships, and incorporate temporal data for longitudinal tracking. The system enables efficient querying and retrieval of medical insights using vector embeddings and temporal analytics, empowering healthcare professionals with actionable, time-sensitive data.
